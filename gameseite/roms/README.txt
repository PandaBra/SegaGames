To make the games work from the library list:
1. Obtain the ROM files for the games (e.g., sonic2.md, mortal_kombat.md).
2. Place them in this "roms" folder.
3. Ensure the filenames match the IDs in index.html:
   - sonic2.md
   - mortal_kombat.md
   - streets_of_rage.md

Alternatively, use the "Upload your own game" button on the site to play any .md/.bin file from your computer immediately.
